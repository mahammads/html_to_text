MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "Note About Forward-Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."

Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results

Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Seasonality and other

Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our non-advertising revenues, including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.

Revenues and Monetization Metrics

Google Services

Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”) as well as revenues from other sources (“Google other revenues”).

Google Advertising

Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following:

•

Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;

•

YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and

•

Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.

We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners’ properties.

Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.

Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.

As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.

Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:

•

advertiser competition for keywords;


•

changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;

•

changes in device mix;

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;

•

general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including the effect of COVID-19, geopolitical events, regulations and other measures;

•

seasonality; and

•

traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.

Google Other

Google other revenues are comprised of the following:

•

Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;

•

Devices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;

•

YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and

•

other products and services.

Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:

•

Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;

•

Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and

•

other enterprise services.

Other Bets

Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.

For further details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

Costs and Expenses

Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.

•

TAC includes:

◦

Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.

◦

Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.

•

Other cost of revenues includes:

◦

Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).


◦

Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).

◦

Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.

The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.

The main components of our R&D expenses are:

•

compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and new products and services;

•

depreciation; and

•

professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.

The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:

•

compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and

•

spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.

The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:

•

compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;

•

expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and

•

professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.

For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur

nual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For additional details, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8

Executive Overview

(1)

Foreign currency movements affected year-over-year revenue growth rates by 3.7%. This reflects, when rounding to the one decimal place, the percentage change in consolidated revenues and consolidated constant currency revenues year over year of 12.6% and 16.3%, respectively.

•

Revenues were $69.7 billion, an increase of 13% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in Google Services segment revenues of $5.8 billion or 10% and an increase in Google Cloud segment revenues of $1.6 billion or 36%.

•

Cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, an increase of 15% year over year, driven by increases in other costs of revenues and TAC.

•

Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, an increase of 24% year over year, primarily driven by increases in compensation due to headcount growth, professional services fees and advertising and promotional expenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters.

Other information

•

On July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All references made to share or per share amounts throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and effectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our financial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future financial results may be unpredictable.

Financial Results

Revenues

Google Services

Google advertising revenues

Google Search & other

Google Search & other revenues increased $4.8 billion and $12.6 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, growth in advertiser spending, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.

YouTube ads

YouTube ads revenues increased $338 million and $1.2 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The growth was driven by our brand and direct response advertising products. Growth for both products was primarily driven by increased spending by our advertisers as well as improvements to ad formats and delivery.

Google Network

Google Network revenues increased $662 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdSense.

Google Network revenues increased $2.0 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdSense and AdMob.

Monetization Metrics

Paid clicks and cost-per-click

Paid clicks increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, driven by a number of interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.


Cost-per-click was relatively unchanged from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022 and increased from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to a number of interrelated factors including changes in device mix, geographic mix, growth in advertiser spending, ongoing product changes, and property mix.

Impressions and cost-per-impression

Impressions increased from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily driven by growth across Google Ad Manager, AdSense, and AdMob. The increase in cost-per-impression from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was driven by a number of interrelated factors including ongoing product and policy changes, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in device mix, geographic mix, product mix, and property mix.

Google other revenues

Google other revenues decreased $70 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by a decrease in Google Play revenues, partially offset by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. The growth in YouTube non-advertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers.

Google other revenues increased $247 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The growth was primarily driven by YouTube non-advertising, largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The overall growth was partially offset by a decrease in Google Play revenues, primarily driven bythe fee structure changes we announced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending.

Google Cloud

Google Cloud revenues increased $1.6 billion and $3.4 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by GCP followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud's infrastructure and platform services were the largest drivers of growth in GCP.

Revenues by Geography

For further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change

The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.

Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.

These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues increased $3.9 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $2.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Cost of revenues increased $9.4 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $5.8 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.

The increase in

TAC from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate was 21.7% in both the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the three months ended June 30, 2022. The TAC rate increased from 21.7% to 21.8% from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. The TAC rate on Google Search & other properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.

The increase in other cost of revenues from the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center and other operations costs, including depreciation expense, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.

Research and Development

R&D expenses increased $2.2 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.4 billion, largely resulting from a 18% increase in headcount, and an increase in professional services fees of $312 million.

R&D expenses increased $3.8 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $2.3 billion, largely resulting from a 17% increase in headcount, and an increase in professional services fees of $456 million.


Sales and Marketing

The following table presents sales and marketing expenses (in millions, except percentages):

Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $603 million and an increase in compensation expenses of $536 million, largely resulting from a 20% increase in headcount.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $2.7 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.1 billion and an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $1.1 billion. The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to a 20% increase in headcount. The increase in advertising and promotional activities was driven by both increased spending in the current period and a reduction in spending in the prior year comparable period due to COVID-19.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased $316 million from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in professional services fees of $311 million and an increase in compensation expenses of $309 million, largely resulting from a 23% increase in headcount. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters of $623 million.

General and administrative expenses increased $917 million from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $600 million, largely resulting from a 21% increase in headcount, and an increase in professional services fees of $597 million. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in charges related to legal matters of $792 million.

Other income (e

xpense), net, decreased $3.1 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to gains and losses on equity and debt securities and changes in accrued performance fees. In the three months ended June 30, 2022, $1.2 billion of net unrealized losses were recognized on marketable equity securities and $790 million of net losses on debt securities. These losses were partially offset by $911 million of net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities and a $318 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments. In the three months ended June 30, 2021, $2.6 billion of net unrealized gains on marketable and non-marketable equity securities were recognized, partially offset by $523 million of accrued performance fees related to certain investments.

Provision for Income Taxes

The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate):

The effective tax rate increased 0.1% from the three months ended June 30, 2021 to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The effective tax rate was affected by offsetting factors including decreases in the stock-based compensation-related tax benefit, and in pre-tax earnings (including in countries that have lower statutory rates), offset primarily by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.

The effective tax rate decreased 1.2% from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generating an increase in the U.S. federal Foreign-Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, offset primarily by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates.

Financial Condition

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

As of June 30, 2022, we had

$125.0 billion

in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Ca

sh equivalents and marketable securities a

re comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.

Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends

Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.

The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.

Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, for compensation and related costs, and for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022

primarily due to the net effect of increases in cash received from revenues, increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, offset by an increase in tax payments driven by the


effects of capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and other working capital.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to a net decrease in cash used for purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase of purchases of property and equipment.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.

Net cash used in financing activities increased from the six months ended June 30, 2021 to the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock.

Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.

Capital Expenditures and Leases

We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:

•

technical infrastructure, which consists of investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning (collectively referred to as information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and

•

office facilities, ground up development projects, and related building improvements.

Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets.

During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, capital expenditures were $11.4 billion and $16.6 billion, respectively. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $5.3 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9 years, was $16.2 billion. As of June 30, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $4.9 billion, excluding purchase options, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.


For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.

We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial p

aper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2022, we had no

commercial paper outstanding.

As of June 30, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in April 2026

The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals.

No amounts

have been borrowed under the credit facilities.

As of June 30, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of

$12.9 billion

The repurchases from the April 2021 authorization were completed during the second quarter of 2022.
